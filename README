## An application that:

Takes an audio input (live mic or uploaded track),

Analyzes it using AI (beat detection, mood/emotion classification),

And visualizes it in real-time using dynamic, colorful animations synced with the audio.

Feature	Description
Real-Time Visualizer	Glowing waveforms, frequency bars, particle effects that sync to beats.
Mood Classifier	AI model tags music as happy/sad/calm/etc.
Automatic Beat Mapping	AI/ML finds beats & key changes.
Editor Tools	Trim audio, add effects, overlay visuals (e.g., light bursts on drum hits).
Export	Save visual as video or audio-visual mix.

🧰 Tech Stack & VS Code Setup
1. 🧱 Core Languages
C++ – for real-time processing & performance visuals

Python – for AI/ML parts (classification, prediction)

2. 🎨 UI + Visualization
Qt 6 with QML – professional, animated, fluid UI

Or optionally Dear ImGui + OpenGL for a "cool dev tool" look

OpenGL / Vulkan – GPU-based visualizations (for smooth performance)

3. 🎧 Audio Handling
RtAudio or PortAudio – real-time audio stream capture

Librosa (Python) – for frequency analysis, tempo, onset detection

FFmpeg – audio file decoding/export

4. 🧠 AI Tools (Python)
TensorFlow / PyTorch – training/using mood models

Scikit-learn – for simpler ML

Pybind11 or ZeroMQ – connect Python ↔ C++

🧩 VS Code Setup & Extensions
✅ Must-Have Extensions:

Extension	Purpose
C/C++ (by Microsoft)	Syntax, intellisense, debugging for C++
Python	Everything Python
CMake Tools	Handle C++ build system
Better C++ Syntax / Clangd	Code highlighting & code actions
Live Share (Optional)	Collaborate or debug remotely
Qt VS Tools (optional but helpful)	Qt dev integration

🧪 How You Interact With It
Launch the App (C++/Qt)

It shows a UI with an "Upload Audio" or "Start Listening" button.

Load a Song / Enable Mic

The backend C++ engine uses PortAudio to capture or decode audio.

AI Kicks In

A Python subprocess (via socket or Pybind11) analyzes the audio:

Detects tempo, beats, emotional profile.

Real-Time Visuals

Visual effects react in real time:

Waveform follows amplitude.

Particles explode on drum hits.

Mood detection changes background color theme (happy = warm, sad = cool).

Editing Mode

Trim parts, add effects (echo, filter), sync visuals.

Export

Renders video using FFmpeg.

🔬 How to Test It
🎧 Start Simple
Start with loading a .wav or .mp3 file.

Use Python (librosa) to detect beats and print timestamps.

Confirm beat locations by printing them to a console.

👀 Visual Test
In C++, trigger a color flash or bar jump every time a beat occurs.

Play a song and visually verify that visuals match.

🧪 AI Test
Load a model that classifies music into moods using pre-extracted features.

Compare predicted mood against human judgment.

🧨 Bonus Ideas to Take It Further
Webcam Integration: React to the user’s face or movement.

Sync Lights: Send MIDI/DMX signals to actual lights.

TikTok Export Mode: One-click vertical video export with effects.
